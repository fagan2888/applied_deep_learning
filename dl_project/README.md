## Final Deep Learning Project - Avazu CTR Prediction

### List of things to cover in the slides and project

* Why did we choose this project - structured data as opposed to a more cool image detection or meme creation
    * X% of all data is structured
    
* Compare shallow to deep
    * Runtime
    * Performance
        * Does it do well for users who have more data
    * Scaling
    * When to use one vs the other

* Models to consider
   * Random Forests
   * XGBoost
   * Logistic Regression
   * DNN
   * Wide and Deep

* Explore possibilities
    * Can we have a version of the model hosted for people to interact with
