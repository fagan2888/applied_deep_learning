## Final Deep Learning Project - Avazu CTR Prediction

### List of things to cover in the slides and project

* Why did we choose this project - structured data as opposed to a more cool image detection or meme creation
    * X% of all data is structured
    
* Compare shallow to deep
    * Runtime
    * Performance
        * Does it do well for users who have more data
    * Scaling
    * When to use one vs the other

* Models to consider
    * Random Forests
    * XGBoost
    * Logistic Regression
    * DNN
    * Wide and Deep

* Explore possibilities
    * Can we have a version of the model hosted for people to interact with?
    * If we are using embeddings on categorical columns, can we project it to 2 or 3D space using
      t-SNE (since we don't have names, it might not be as fun but it's still good to understand
      what's going on here). Also generally, compare t-SNE with PCA for analysis/visualization?
